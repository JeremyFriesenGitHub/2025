## Introduction

<Callout title="What's Extreme Programming (XP)?">
- A set of rigorous software development practices built on top of the Agile methodology.
- Rapid release cadence over tiny development cycles.
- Emphasizes Test-Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Continuous Integration, and Collective Code Ownership.
</Callout>

### Core Principles
TODO: Add color schema to mindmap
```mermaid

  root((Core Principles))
    Communication
        Constant and open communication between all  developers, designers, PMs and users
    Simplicity
        Emphasize the simplest solution that works for the current problem
    Feedback
        Continuous feedback from testing, users, and team members helps adjust the product
    Courage
        The team should be willing to embrace changes and make necessary, bold decisions
    Respect
        Team members should respect each other's contributions and abilities

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="What's Agile?">
    - Project management methodology that emphasizes flexibility, rapid iteration, and user satisfaction.
    - Defined by the 4 values and 12 principles of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="How's Extreme Programming related to Agile?">
    Strong emphasis on the following common values:
    - Straightforward communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage.
    - Highly iterative and incremental.
    - User-centric.
    - Encourage change, flexibility and adaptability
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="How's Extreme Programming different from Agile?">
    - Extreme Programming is a software development methodology, while Agile is a project management methodology.
    - Strong emphasis on technical practices such as TDD, CI/CD, Pair Programming, and Documentation.
    - More prescriptive approach that applies principles the broader Agile framework.
